# RocketRace

You will need to do a few steps before being able to run the project
Mainly you will need to have openFrameworks downloaded

After downloading and unzipping, 
you will need to place it in your openFrameworks/apps/myApps folder

If you are having issues with it not connecting to openFrameworks, 
you will need to take all the contents from the inner RocketRace folder and move it into the outer RocketRace folder

RocketRace/RocketRace/All Content
^ Move all content into this folder

You will need to first rebuild the solution then close it once the bin folder has been created
Then you need to place the data folder into your bin folder before being able to properly run the executable file.
